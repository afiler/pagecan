pagecan will take an URL of an HTML document, grab all resources referenced by
"src", and bundle the page and encoded resources into a single file, through
the use of the data URI scheme. pagecan is written in Ruby and uses the Nokogiri parser.

Usage: pagecan url [file | -]

If '-' or no file is given, output is sent to stdout. pagecan has been tested
only with HTTP URLs, but as it uses Ruby open-uri, other URIs and local files
may work.
